- By default no expiration time, cache "memoizes" values indefinitely
  -- Use the concurrency primitives provided by Akka typed actors to implement the cache behavior behind the scenes?
- It is possible to invalidate a value so that it will be refetched
- It is possible to invalidate the whole cache
- RefreshingCache: Possible to specify the expiration time for a cached item after which it will be "refreshed" in the background
  -- If refresh fails the old value is still used
-- Expiring values: after a certain time a value cached becomes stale and is discarded, possible to configure
- Possible to specify the behavior on fetch failure: retain the previous value or fail
- Support for ZIO/ZIO interface, reimplement in terms of ZIO and provide legacy Future interface?
